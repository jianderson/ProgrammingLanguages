# Description of Accomplished Parts: Jessie and Jillian worked together for this assignment, meeting in the Library multiple times over the week. They attending office hours together via Zoom and practiced pair programming in order to complete the assignment. We were able to complete all parts of the assignment, utilizing notes, each other, office hours and lectures.

# Difficulties: Initially we had some trouble with .gitignore. We knew we wanted to use it in order to make sure we were not committing machine generated files. However, after some internet research we were able to create our .gitingore file and it worked well. We spent a while using a whiteboard to explore different options for the recursive equations and finally settled on ones that worked. We found this process extremely beneficial. Initially we had some confusion surrounding the II data type that impacted our success in implementing multI and other II functions. However, eventually we were able to figure out the structure and how to manipulate it and convert to and from that particular data type. WE also struggled with normalization for this same reason. For Part2 of the assignment, we utilize the :i feature in Haskell which was very helpful.

# Testing: We tested our programs by running through multiple test cases. We accomplished this through both Haskell test cases and by working out test cases by hand. Both methods were extremely useful in checking our work. We also double checked our work by implemented the instructor recommended test cases from the specification file.

# Learnings: First off, we learned how to utilize .gitignore. Secondly, we got practice creating and implementing our own recursive equations. Additionally, we learned more about Haskell and data types in general. Finally, we got practice debugging successfully by reading and learning from error messages that appeared. We discovered how to use the error messages to write the code.

# Interesting Observations: Jessie and Jillian really enjoyed learning about how mathematical numbers translate to symbols when converting them to code. We loved to think about how cool it was that those symbols did not actually represent numbers, but we were still able to use them for our arithmetic purposes. Additionally, we thought utilizing :i in Haskell was an interesting way to learn about the operators and other Haskell features. Also, it was very cool to see how functional programming languages use recursion and type casting to build on top of each other, creating a program that can do so many things.

# Connecting the Assignment to the Theory: This assignment connects back to the theory because these data types are just symbols! We are able to recursively call them in order to create programs and simple executions. The theory behind the Ts and Is relate back to mathematical meanings. These symbols hold deeper meanings that are not realized until the program is executed.

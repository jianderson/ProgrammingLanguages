# Description of Accomplished Parts: Jessie and Jillian worked together for this assignment, meeting in the Library multiple times over the week. They accomplished together the Calculator subtraction and the positive number addition portions of the assignment.

# Difficulties: Initially we had some trouble with .gitignore. We knew we wanted to use it in order to make sure we were not committing machine generated files. However, after some internet research we were able to create our .gitingore file and it worked well. We spent a while using a whiteboard to explore different options for the recursive equation and finally settled on one that worked. We found this process extremely beneficial.

# Testing: We tested our programs by running through multiple test cases. We accomplished this through both Haskell test cases and by working out test cases by hand. Both methods were extremely useful in checking our work.

# Learnings: We learned how to utilize .gitignore. We also got practice creating and implementing our own recursive equations.

# Interesting Observations: Jessie and Jillian really enjoyed learning about how mathematical numbers translate to symbols when converting them to code. We loved to think about how cool it was that those symbols did not actually represent numbers, but were still able to use them for our arithmetic purposes.

# Connecting the Assignment to the Theory: This assignment connects back to the theory because these data types are just symbols! We are able to recursively call them in order to create programs and simple executions. The theory behind the Ts and Is relate back to mathematical meanings. These symbols hold deeper meanings that are not realized until the program is executed.

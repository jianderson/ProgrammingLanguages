# Assignment 2
# Group Members: Jillian Anderson and Jessie Roux
# Submission Date: 11/7/21
# Due Date : 11/7/21

# Description of Accomplished Parts: Jill and Jessie continued to ulitize github. They were able to use the push and pull actions taking turns commiting work. They booked multiple study rooms and Zoomed to ensure they were always working together. They were able to successfully complete all parts of the assignment as well as consider questions that arose throughout the process. They utilized lecture notes, professor office hours, SI sessions and office hours, and external research when needed. 

# Difficulties: One difficulty we ran into was being reminded the importance of data types and proper pattern matching. We constantly asked ourselves "what should be returned and inputted" which helped this process. We used the errors that Haskell gave us to help correct our implementations. To be transparent, we struggled most with part 1 and 2 of the assignment. Once we reviewed abstract syntaxt trees and truly understood the roll they played in how we constructed our code we were able to find success. As for part 3, one thing we struggled with was ensuring we were using the correct context free grammar. Often times we were missing parentheses or having other syntax errors so referencing our grammar helped a lot.

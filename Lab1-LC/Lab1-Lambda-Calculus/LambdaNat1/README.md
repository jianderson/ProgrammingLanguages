# README

To parse and run a program in the language LambdaNat:

- (I assume you have Haskell and bnfc)

- fork the [programming-languages-2020](https://github.com/alexhkurz/programming-languages-2020/) repo
  
- cd into this directory, `Lab1-Lambda-Calculus/LambdaNat0`

- generate a parser as described [here](https://github.com/alexhkurz/programming-languages-2020/blob/master/Lab1-Lambda-Calculus/README.md)

- build an interpreter with `stack build` 

- choose or write a `mypgrogram.lc` in the folder `test`

- run `stack exec LambdaNat-exe test/myprogram.lc`
